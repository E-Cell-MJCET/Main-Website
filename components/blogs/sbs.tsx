      <BlogSub text="Define Your Brand Identity" />
      <BlogText text="Before you can begin creating a logo or a marketing campaign, you need to define your brand identity. This is the foundation on which your brand will be built. It involves asking deep questions about who you are as a company and what you want to represent. Here's what you should consider when defining your brand identity:" />

            <span className="text-lg font-bold">
              a. Your Mission and Vision
            </span>{" "}
            Your mission is the core purpose of your startup, why your business
            exists and what problem it seeks to solve. Your vision is a
            reflection of your long-term goals where you want your startup to be
            in the future. Together, these form the guiding principles of your
            brand.
            <BlogBigText text="-Mission:" />
            <BlogText text="What is your startup solving? What value are you providing to your customers?" />

          <li>
            <span className="text-lg font-bold">b. Your Core Values</span> Brand
            values are the beliefs and principles that guide your business’s
            actions. They reflect your company’s culture and ethics, and they
            resonate with customers who share similar beliefs. Some examples
            might include:
            <BlogBigText text="-Sustainability: " />
            <BlogText text=" If your brand focuses on eco-friendly products, this value will be central to your messaging and customer interactions." />
            <BlogBigText text="-Customer-Centricity:" />
            <BlogText text=" If your startup puts customers at the heart of everything it does, then this should be reflected in your brand identity." />

            <span className="text-lg font-bold">c. Target Audience</span> Your
            brand can’t appeal to everyone. It’s important to define who your
            ideal customer is. Who are they? What do they care about? What are
            their pain points? Creating buyer personas is a great way to get
            into the mind of your target audience and understand their
            preferences, behaviors, and needs.
            <BlogText text="By understanding your audience deeply, you can tailor your brand messaging and tone to resonate with them." />

            </span>{" "}
            Just like people, brands have personalities. Some brands are formal,
            while others are playful or adventurous. Consider how you want your
            brand to come across to your audience:
            <BlogBigText text="- Tone of Voice: " />
            <BlogText text=" Should your brand be friendly, authoritative, or humorous? Your tone of voice will determine how your brand communicates with customers." />
